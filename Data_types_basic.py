# Data types 
# There are different categories in data types they are:-
# 1 Numerical
# 2 sequencial
# 3 Mapping
# In Numerical
# 1 integer 
# 2 float
# 3 complex
# In Sequencial:-
# 1 list 
# 2 tuple
# 3 set 
# 4 forezenset 
# 5 range
# 6 string
# 7 bytes
# 8 bytearray
# In Mapping:- 
# 1 Dictionary
# - bool
# - None

# Built in functions in python are:-
# 1 print
# 2 type
# 3 id

# How many ways are there to represent integer values?
# There are total four form to represent:- 
# 1 Decimal form
# 2 Binary form
# 3 octal form
# 4 hexadecimal form

# In Decimal form:- 0 to 9
# Eg:- a= 10

# In Binary form:- 0 & 1
# Eg:- a = 0B1011

# In octal form:- 0 to 7
# Eg:- a= 0o1011

# In hexadecimal form:- 0 to 9 & A  to F
# Eg:- a = 0X1011

# Where 1011 =  11

# Data types:-
# int:- 
# Eg:- a = 10

# float:-
# Eg:- a = 2.5 or Ï€ = 3.14

# Complex:-
# Eg:- a = 2 + 3 j
# Where 2 is real part
# and 3 is imaginary part

# Bool:-
# Eg:- a = True or a = False
# Where True represent 1 and,
# False represent 0
